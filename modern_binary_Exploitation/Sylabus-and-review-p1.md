# Course Terminology

 - Machine 
   - A computer,Server,Sommetines refers to the actial CPU
 - Binary 
    - An executable such as an .EXE,ELF,MachO or other code containters that run on a machine
    - Other name:program,application,service (sometime)
 - Malware
   - A malicious binary meant to persist on a machine such as a Rootkit or Remote Access Tool (RAT)
 - Vulnerability
   - A bug in a binary that can Be leveraged by an exploit
 - Exploit
   - Specially crafted data that utilizes vulnerabilities to force the binary into doing something unintended
   - By this definition,exploits are not explicitly malware
 - 0day
   - A previously unknown or uppatched vulnerability that can be used by an exploit
   - An 0day can also be an exploit using the unpatched vuln
   - Pwn/Pwninggit push -u origin master
     - In security,pwning commonly refers to vulnerability research and exploit development


# Goals for This  Course

 - This will be a very applied,hands on course
   - No data structures,algorithms,cryptography,or cyber policy
   - Every Lecture after this you're expected to bring your laptop

# Why learn binary exploitation ?

 - Can't defend against what you don't understand
 - Gain an intimate understanding of how programs really work
  
# Course Roadmap

 - We start off with the fundamentals required
   - Basic reverse engineering,memory corruption,classical exploitation
 - Different classes of vulnerabilities are introduced and how they can be leveraged in exploitation
   - Stack smashes,format strings,signed/unsigned,Heap,UAF
 - Modern exploit mitigations are intorduced and how they can be bypassed in exploitation
   - DEP,ASLR,GS/Cookies,


# Quick Linux Overview

 - UNIX-like open source kernel used by many open source operating systems distros
 - Written in C and assembly
 - ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file for binaries


# Learning Command Line Linux

 - We'll be spending a lot of time using linux at the command line in this class,so you'll need to learn your way around
 - Get familiar with the linux command line if you aren't already
  

# The C proramming Language

 - Designed in 1969-1972 for writing UNIX operatiing system
 - Imperative system programming language
   - Very fast,compiled language
   - Extremely fine control over memory and the machine
 - Compared to modern languages C is considered a "Low level" language.



# Language Depth
 - High Level
   - Ruby / Javascript / Python
 - Middle Level
   - C++ / C# / Java
 - Low Level
   - C / Fortran / COBOL
 - Assembly Code
   - x86 / x64 / ARM / PPC
 - Machine Code
   - Binary / Hex
 - CPU - Hardware


# Hello World! C Source

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc,char * argv[]){
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}

```

# compiling / Running

```bash
    $gcc helloworld.c  -o helloworld
    
    $./helloworld
```
